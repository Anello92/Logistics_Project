# Project Title: Predicting Package Contents in Logistics Centers

## Problem Statement
One of the critical issues faced by logistics companies is the quick and accurate identification of package contents to ensure they are handled appropriately, preventing damage. Often, external packaging does not provide clear indications of its contents, leading to improper handling, additional costs, and customer dissatisfaction.

## Proposed Solution
Develop a Machine Learning model that, based on two simple variables - the weight of the package and the type of packaging - can predict the electronic product contained within the package. This model will enable logistics center staff to quickly identify and classify packages, ensuring that each product receives the appropriate treatment during the logistics process.

## Data Collection
It is essential to collect data on the weight and type of packaging of different electronic products. This dataset will serve as the basis for training the model.

## Model Development
Using modern Machine Learning techniques, the model will be trained to correlate weight and type of packaging with the specific electronic product.

## Evaluation and Optimization
Once trained, the model will be evaluated on its ability to accurately predict package contents on a test dataset. Depending on the results, adjustments and optimizations may be necessary.

## Deployment
With the trained and optimized model, it will be deployed in a web application, allowing logistics center employees to input the weight and type of packaging and receive a real-time prediction of the package contents.

## Benefits
The successful implementation of this system will bring several benefits, such as reducing product damage, optimizing storage and transportation processes, and increasing customer satisfaction. Additionally, by minimizing errors and improving efficiency, significant reductions in the company's operational costs are expected.
